# Project Description

This is a node application that utilizes Google sheets, Puppeteer and Clearbit. This application will
customize your cover letter, apply to your job application link, and then update your spreadsheet to
keep track of which jobs you applied for. Should you want to follow-up with the recruiter to check on status,
you can do that as well.

## Motivation

This application was born from the issue that I (and others) were facing, in that applying to jobs for a
certain website was too time consuming. This is my answer to save time.
