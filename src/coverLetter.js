    const cv = `Dear ${hiringManager}\n\nWhen I found the opening for the ${position} position with ${company}, I felt as if it was addressed to me. My current tools and skillsets align perfectly with your current tech stack, and I'd love to contribute to ${company} with my current skillsets. Using those skills, I've built a front-end application using languages/frameworks such as Javascript, React/Redux and using tools such as webpack and docker. I've also designed, scaled and optimized a RESTful back-end of a housing reservation application using nodeJS, express, postgreSQL. I'd be happy to elaborate on some of the decisions and details I've made within these projects. I've always been passionate about innovative software that pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved. Can we schedule a meeting to discuss a potential fit between ${company} and myself? Feel free to contact me at albertlaptu@gmail.com or (510)378-2356`;
